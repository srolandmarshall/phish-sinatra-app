# phish-sinatra-app
Learn.co Sinatra Project

I have developed an app to create reviews for shows by the band Phish. I have scraped all their shows from Phish.net and created a mechanism to review them.

To start:
1. Download the package from GitHub.
2. Then `cd <folder-download-location>` in terminal.
3. Type `bundle install` to install necessary gems
4. Type `shotgun` to launch server
5. Go to http://localhost:9393/ and begin by registering.

Here is a demonstration of the code and the application:
